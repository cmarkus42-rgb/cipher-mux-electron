// src/main/mcp/entity-header.ts — Role identity on the MCP connection.
//
// Sibling of workspace-header.ts, for the same reason: the MCP server cannot
// tell its callers apart, because everyone shares one URL and one bearer
// token. The workspace already rides on the connection; the role did not, so
// the server had no way to answer "which entity is asking".
//
// Two things need that answer and neither is reachable otherwise:
//
//  - Companion memory belongs to the Companion role. Dropping the tool from
//    an entity's permission list does NOT withhold it — a missing permission
//    only produces an approval prompt. Tools have to not be registered for
//    that connection at all.
//  - Role boundaries as a constraint: what a role may touch has to be decided
//    where the role is known.
//
// As with the workspace, the identity is bound once at initialize rather than
// passed as a tool parameter the model can forget or get wrong.
